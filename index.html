                Things that interest C.J.:
            </h1>
            <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>It's always interesting how someone chooses to express themselves.</p> 
            <p>Before even creating the art, an artist must decide on its medium.</p> 
            <p>The medium can be anything from oil on a canvas to dressing a particular way to creating films.</p> 
            <p>Thinking deeper into why the artist chose the medium they did as well as their execution on the medium really excites me.</p> 
            <p>Everyone is an Artist.</p>
            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>There are so many intelligent people in this World creating very cool technology.</p> 
            <p>I wish it was used for less <s>nefarious purposes</s> but it's still cool all the less. </p>
            <p>The speed at which technology is advancing always keeps it interesting as it seems there's always something new to look out for.</p> 
            <p>Never a dull moment. </p>
            <p>Keep it coming.</p>
            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>A big reason why I'm competitive, driven to succeed and always keen to practice.</p>
            <p>Everyone has a role to play no matter how <b>big</b> or <em>small</em>.</p>
            <p><b>Such is life.üçÉ</b></p>
